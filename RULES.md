There will be two modes initially available, **sandbox** and **story** mode.

Era
===

The game data will be split into eras. An era is a time period defining
certain details such as editors contained, as well as languages and the like.

Sandbox
=======

Sandbox allows the user to select the 'eras' that are available for the game
once set they cannot be changed.

Story
=====

In story mode, difficult determines how far back the game will start and thus
how powerful some of the tools are. As with money and the like, older stuff
can scale to be better than new or worse, depending on the conditions.
