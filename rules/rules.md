There will be two modes initially available, **sandbox** and **story** mode.

Era
===

The game data will be split into eras. An era is a time period defining
certain details such as editors contained, as well as languages and the like.

Sandbox
=======

Sandbox allows the user to select the 'eras' that are available for the game
once set they cannot be changed.

Story
=====

In story mode, difficult determines how far back the game will start and thus
how powerful some of the tools are. As with money and the like, older stuff
can scale to be better than new or worse, depending on the conditions.

Story mode itself has two flavors, timed and untimed. In timed, the eras will
auto-advance, like life, and untimed is where players will need to fulfill
certain conditions to advance the timeline. In the case of it being timed,
players can possibly compete for a high score.

Events
======

As with other games, we need random events of some form. Perhaps a 'bit' of
the day or even a 'nibble'? Maybe we can make it an upgrade. To move onto
a 'byte' you have to upgrade. Maybe we can show the event level as an apple
that gets closer to being just a core of an apple as more bites are taken.

Alternatively, we might just might consider it a 'flag'.

Ballmer Peak
============
This might just be the golden cookie in this game. Hitting this, correctly,
will yield increase generation of SLOC.
