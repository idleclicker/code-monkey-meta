The notion of **era**, will be contained in a JSON file.

Units of SLOC Gens are (SLOC/s)
Upgrades must start with a math operator
  (+-) increase the generation rate at a constant amount
  (\*/) increaset the generation rate depending on how
    many production currently using

All eras have 'worker' units that perform the task. They
can moved to do work with their cost decreasing over
eras.

Another question to consider, do we make upgrades cheaper
over time, more expensive or the same price?
